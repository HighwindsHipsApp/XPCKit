#pragma mark - Message Dispatching

// Dispatch a message with optional argument object to a target object asynchronously.
// When XPConnection is not nil the message will be transfered to XPC service for execution
//     (i.e. target and object must conform to NSCoding when connection is not nil).
// When XPCConnection is nil (e.g. running on Snow Leopard) message will be dispatched asynchronously via GCD.
